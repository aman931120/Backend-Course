// React course : in this section we are going to learn about text...

<-- Introduction Lecture -->
‚≠ê Why to learn React ?
    -> hype, job, trend, build UI(user interface)
    -> makes easy to manage and build complex frontend

‚≠ê When should I learn React ?
    -> After mastering JavaScript
    -> Most project donot need react in initial phase

‚≠ê Why react was created ?
    -> Ghost message Problem 
    -> No consistency in UI
    -> React was created to solve performance, scalability, and maintainability issues in front-end development.

‚≠ê Don't learn React if :
    -> you don't know how JS works OR DOM works

‚≠ê React learning Process :
    -> go-in-depth
    -> by making project(one topic at a time) : Todo, calculator, github API etc

‚≠ê React is a library
    -> framework V|S library
    -> Yes, React is a JavaScript library, not a framework. It was designed specifically for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs).

‚≠ê Topic to learn
    -> core of React (state or UI manipulation, JSX)
    -> component Reusability
    -> Reusing of component (props)
    -> How to propogate change (hooks)

‚≠ê Additional Addon to React
    -> Router (React donot have router)
    -> State management (React donot have state management)
        [Redux, Redux toolkit, zustland, context API]
    -> class based component
        [legacy code]
    -> BAAS apps
        [Social media clone, e-commerce apps.....]




<-- Lecture 2 -->
‚≠ê npx : node package executor
üî± "npx create-react-app 01basicreact" this is a command, it is a bulky utility so it takes time to set up in our vs code [IDE]

üî± "npm run start" is used to run the react app 
üî± "npm run build" creates a build folder

üî± "npm create vite@latest" we will create react setup
üî± "npm install" it will install all the packages

‚≠ê Files that we will deleted from [01basicreact]
    -> setupTests.JS
    -> reportWebVitals.js
    -> logo.svg
    -> App.test.js
    -> App.css 
    -> index.css

‚≠ê Files that we will delete from [01vitereact]
    -> assets folder
    -> App.css
    -> index.css




<-- Lecture 3 -->
React is a SPA [single page application]

‚≠ê What is JSX in React?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to write UI components. It looks similar to HTML but allows JavaScript expressions inside it. JSX makes it easier to create and visualize UI elements by combining HTML-like syntax with JavaScript logic.

‚≠ê What is App.js 
It is basically a function that returns a HTML, and in last we export that function 

‚≠ê Inside 01vitereact
    -> in this we can create chai.jsx and it is basically another function with uppercase letter

‚≠ê Inside 01basicreact
    -> in this we created a chai.js and this chai .js is a component
    -> this chai.js is exported to app.js and then it is used 

 


<-- Lecture 4 -->
GOAL : create your own react library and JSX 
In this we are going to create "Khud ka react"

‚≠ê Not necessary to learn 
    -> first we created customReact folder and in that folder we made two files first is customReact.js and index.HTML
    -> This customReact.js is basically our main react
        > we loaded the root(index.html) file
        > we created a anchor tag
    
‚≠ê Bundler : Every react uses a bundler
bundler is a tool that takes your project's various files (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.), processes them, and combines them into optimized, browser-friendly output.





<-- Lecture 5 -->
GOAL : Why we need HOOKS ?

‚≠ê WE created a folder which is 02counter using vite command

‚≠ê Nextstep :
    -> UI upatation is controlled by react
    -> we add features of addvalue and remove value
