⭐ SERVER:
Server is something that serves, A server is a computer or a system that provides services or resources to other computers, called clients, over a network.
example : Nodejs and Bun

⭐ Node.js and Bun in the Context of Web Servers
JavaScript runtime environments used for building and running web servers, but they have different purposes and optimizations.

⭐ Creating Server with help of "Nodejs"
    ->http.createServer() creates a web server.
    ->The callback function (req, res) => {} runs every time a client (like a web browser) makes a request to the server.
        ->req (request) represents the incoming request (from the browser).
        ->res (response) is used to send a response back to the client.

⭐ Postman [use for testing]
Postman is used to test APIs before integrating them into a frontend like React.

⭐ Creating Server with help of "BUN"
What Should You Focus On?
✅ How Bun's serve() function works (like http.createServer in Node.js)
✅ How routing works (checking url.pathname)
✅ How responses are sent using new Response()
What Can You Skip?
❌ Exact syntax (you can always Google it)
❌ Remembering every method (as long as you understand the logic)

⭐ Nothing much he is just telling about the backend series. 
⭐ He is telling about course and he is telling about "GOAL" and here he will tell about transferrable knowledge.
⭐ complex and scalable backend.

⭐ Introduction : 
This lecture is based on how we can do Postman testing and how we check postman and how all the things works in Postman .
